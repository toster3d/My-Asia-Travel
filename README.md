# Travel Website

This is my first travel website where I showcase my travel adventures through a collection of photographs. Below you'll find a brief description of the project along with instructions for running and customizing the website.

See the page by clicking: [Travel Website]( https://toster3d.github.io/)

## Description

The Travel Website is a place where I share my experiences and journeys from different corners of south-east Asia. It features a photo gallery from my travel. The website was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and some JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To run the website, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
